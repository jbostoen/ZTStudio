**I just want to use this! Help!**
* https://github.com/jbostoen/ZTStudio/releases
* Each release (latest on top) offers the program + source code. Choose to download the .ZIP-file.
* Download and unzip to your PC
* Run "Start ZT Studio.bat"

You do need [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks) .
In Windows 10, this is usually installed by default if you're on the 1903 build. No action needed.
In Windows 7 Service Pack 1 and 8, you'll most likely need to download and install this from Microsoft.
Older Windows versions are not supported.
