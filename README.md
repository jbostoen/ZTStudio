**I just want to use this! Help!**
* https://github.com/jbostoen/ZTStudio/releases
* Each release (latest on top) offers the program + source code. Choose to download the .ZIP-file.
* Download and unzip to your PC
* Run "Start ZT Studio.bat"

You do need one of the following .NET Frameworks : 4.5 , 4.6 or 4.7 .
In Windows 10, this is usually installed by default. No action needed.
In Windows 7 and 8, you might need to download and install this from Microsoft.
 

**Using this code?**

Please credit:
- MadScientist for figuring out most of the common ZT1 graphic format (and Jay for some additional info)
- myself for ZT Studio and figuring out how the background frame and MM shadow format works
- Vondell for providing demo/test graphics
- HENDRIX for some contributions to the source code

Pull Requests are welcome, although I'm not actively working on this tool anymore. 
When forking or using code or ideas explained in the documentation: please publish the complete code of your project too.
