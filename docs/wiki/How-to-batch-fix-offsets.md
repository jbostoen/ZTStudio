# How to batch fix offsets

This is also referred to as "rotation fixing".

**All frames in one graphic**

* When manually fixing a graphic (after opening the file in ZT Studio), toggle the toolstrip button which automatically adjusts all the frames in the graphic you're currently editing.

**All frames in multiple graphics**

There's also another batch rotation fix feature. This one allows you to adjust all frames in several graphics - at once! 
This is useful when people have lots of PNG Graphics where the animal is 'too high' in the frame.

* Open a single graphic first, to determine how much the offsets should be changed (frames up/down, left/right and how many pixels). Find out by changing the offsets, but **do not save**.
* Hit the button with the arrows in all directions. You'll be asked to specify the (sub)folder of the ZT1 Graphics this procedure will apply to and to specify how the offsets needs to be changed.
