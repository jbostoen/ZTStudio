# How to change name of a ZT1 folder containing graphics

**1. Convert all ZT1 files to PNG files**

**2. Rename the folder**
* Follow the ZT1 convention: maximum 8 characters [alphanumeric only, no spaces etc]. 
* Avoid conflicts with official content and custom content by others  

**3. Rename necessary files**
* If there is a palette with the same name of the original folder (e.g. 'restrant'), rename this .pal file as well (to name-of-the-folder.pal).

**4. Convert all PNG files back to ZT1**
* Do make sure to auto-generate the .ani-files (enable this in the Settings Window)
