Use ZT Studio's powerful batch conversion.


**1. Convert all ZT1 files to PNG files**

**2. Rename the folder**
* Follow the ZT1 convention: maximum 8 characters [alphanumeric only, no spaces etc]. 
* Avoid conflicts with official content and custom content by others  

**3. Rename necessary files**
* If you see a palette with the same name of the original folder (e.g. 'restrant'), rename your .pal file as well.

**4. Convert all PNG files back to ZT1**
* do make sure to auto-generate the .ani-files

No need to mess around with a hex editor like in the old days. 
ZT Studio will do the job for you. Sit back and relax - it can take a while.
