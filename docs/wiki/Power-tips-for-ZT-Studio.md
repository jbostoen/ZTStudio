Some buttons have shortcuts.
* Right click **Save**. This will save the file under its last known name. If not saved yet, it will ask to specify a filename anyhow.
* Right click **Import PNG**. This will add a new frame and then allow you to import a new graphic.
* Right click **move buttons (hand icons)**. Rather than move 1 pixel, they will move 16 pixels at once (half a square).

**crop to largest relevant width/height in this graphic:** 
- slowest option when converting from ZT1 to PNG.
