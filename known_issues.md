Known issues:
* export Atlantean Arch -> full canvas -> reimport: seems to remember dimensions, but issue with transparency?
* some actions seem to result in representation of incorrect number of frames, or toggling of buttons. More info needed.
* canvas not cleared when switching to an empty frame


* Perhaps add note about plaques, they may need to contain a transparent pixel on loading

Todo
* test if 1px image can be imported
